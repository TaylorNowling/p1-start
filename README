This file is here to give some structure on how to run the code and some name 
choices for the materials
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I created the file on my local drive as new-p1 becasue I deleated the raw-data 
folder on p1-start (this caused a lot of set back but I recovered a lot from github itself)

In raw-data/ all of the files were re-named to be easier to type such as 'steel' rather than the complex long name (this made it a lot easier to call on the data)

Some of the data I renamed to be "material name"-sp-#(1, 2, or 3) to specify the specimen we are talking about (hence the 'sp')

The way I have plot.py set up, to run a graph you type in the command line:
'python plot.py raw-data/#(material you want to run here).raw

The program will now display a Young's Modulus and a line of best fit for the graphs

I am using the [9:-4] for the title becasue it will grab the name of the material only

I had to troubleshoot a lot with the graph and linear fit becasue it was printing two graphs so I had to move the code used to generate the line so it goes onto the same graph

There were a lot of challenges in this project but I felt prepared for them with the help of my class mates and the lessons from before. I felt this was a good test of skills and I'm happy on how I progressed through it hitting many chalenges along the way!

I learned a lot of things in this project like how to use vim and bash in a useful manor and I feel a lot more comfortable in programming. I feel like this was a great way to learn the real world aspect of programming and it shows how useful it will be in other classes!
