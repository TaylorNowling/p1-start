This file is here to give some structure on how to run the code and some name 
choices for the materials
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I created the file on my local drive as new-p1 becasue I deleated the raw-data 
folder on p1-start

In raw-data/ all of the files were re-named to be easier to type such as 'steel' rather than the complex long name

Some of the data I renamed to be "material name"-sp-#(1, 2, or 3) to specify the specimen we are talking about (hence the 'sp')

The way I have plot.py set up, to run a graph you type in the command line:
'python plot.py raw-data/#(material you want to run here).raw #material you want to run'

The program will now display a Young's Modulus and a line of best fit for the graphs

I am using the [9:-4] for the title becasue it will grab the name of the material only

I had to trouble shoot a lot with the graph and linear fit becasue it was printing two graphs so I had to move the code used to generate the line so it goes onto the same graph
